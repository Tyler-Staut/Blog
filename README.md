# About Me

## Tyler Staut

I am currently a cloud security engineer working to become a certified penetration tester.

I have a personal home lab where I can experiment with just about anything. My recent project was setting up flight aware to track aircraft in my area. I want to eventually take this a step further and gather weather data from satellites.

I am using this blog to help me on my pen-testing journey and will include a lot of information I find useful and writeups so I can search them easily later.
