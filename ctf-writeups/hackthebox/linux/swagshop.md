First thing we want to do is run rustscan and see what services are available

Port 80 is open and viewing the site we see this

After adding swagshop.htb to my `/etc/hosts` file we see this

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png>)

## Enumeration

The site is running Magento, which is an open-source e-commerce platform written in PHP.&#x20;

It looks like there is not an easy way too enumerate users

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (24).png>)

The copyright at the bottom of the page says 2014 so this has not been updated in a while. We can use something called [magescan](https://github.com/steverobbins/magescan) to get some information

Running `php magescan.phar scan:all swagshop.htb > output.scan` we get (truncated).

{% code title="output.scan" %}
```

{% endcode %}

Doing a quick searchsploit for magento we get

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png>)

The authenticated one looks good but none of the combos I tried worked so I am going to skip that

Exploit 37977 looks interesting though, we can see it here: [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37977](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37977)

## Exploitation

For the exploit script I added the target

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (29).png>)

After running it we have a bit of a problem

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)

Looking in the script it is trying to go to `target + /admin/Cms_Wysiwyg/directive/index/`

Looking at the site we cant hit that

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (28).png>)

Looking at the working site itt has `index.php` in the url so trying that it looks like it works

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (27).png>)

After making a slight change to the script things look to be working

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (26).png>)

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png>)

We got the admin panel!!!

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png>)

## Initial Access

Now that we are authenticated lets try that other exploit found here: [https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37811](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37811)

Modifying the config to the correct install date and the credentials we got from the exploiit

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png>)

We get a ‚Äúmechanize.\_form\_controls.ControlNotFoundError‚Äù.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

After searchiing google I found this on stackoverflow: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35226169/clientform-ambiguityerror-more-than-one-control-matching-name](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35226169/clientform-ambiguityerror-more-than-one-control-matching-name)

We need to make a slight code change

```python
## Comment out this code found in the script

#br.form.new_control('text', 'login[username]', {'value': username})  
#br.form.fixup()
#br['login[username]'] = username
#br['login[password]'] = password

## Add this code in place of what is above

userone = br.find_control(name="login[username]", nr=0)
userone.value = username
pwone = br.find_control(name="login[password]", nr=0)
pwone.value = password
```

Running `python2 37811.py http://10.129.204.24/index.php/admin/ "whoami"` we get another issue

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png>)

We also need to follow redirects it looks like

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (31).png>)

There was also another issue that I found because the machine was old and not patched recently but you have to create a shipment and make sure it is in the processnig state. I found a note on the forum here: [https://forum.hackthebox.com/t/swagshop/1539/1229](https://forum.hackthebox.com/t/swagshop/1539/1229)

Now running the exploit we get output!

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (32).png>)

Time to get a shell back

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (30).png>)

Here we can find user.txt

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: I have hidden part of the flag
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>user.txt</summary>

14ec7eda2d7de9a1\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

</details>

## Privilege Escalation

Running `sudo -l` we see something interesting

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (21).png>)

We are allowed to run sudo on any files in `/var/www/html/`

Running this gets us root!

```bash
sudo vi /var/www/html/bla -c ':!/bin/sh'
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: I have hidden part of the flag
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>root.txt</summary>

e8b205cbe5faa101\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

</details>

## Lessons Learned

1. Make sure to check for information disclosure. The `/app/etc/local.xml` file was exposed to everyone!
2. Always read the scripts and understand what they are doing. I got held up the longest because there were no shipments in the last 2 years so I had to create one in the admin panel to get the exploit to work.
