## Forward Shell <a href="#forward-shell" id="forward-shell"></a>

You might find cases where you have a **RCE in a web app in a, Linux machine** but due to Iptables rules or other kind of filtering **you cannot get a reverse shell**. This "shell" allows you to maintain a PTY shell through that RCE using pipes inside the victim system. You can find the code inâ€‹You just need to modify: [https://github.com/IppSec/forward-shell](https://github.com/IppSec/forward-shell)

* The URL of the vulnerable host
* The prefix and suffix of your payload (if any)
* The way the payload is sent (headers? data? extra info?)

Then, you can just **send commands** or even **use the `upgrade` command** to get a full PTY (note that pipes are read and written with an approximate 1.3s delay).
