# SSH Tunnel

```
ssh -L [LOCAL_IP:]LOCAL_PORT:DESTINATION:DESTINATION_PORT [USER@]SSH_SERVER
```



The options used are as follows:

* `[LOCAL_IP:]LOCAL_PORT` - The local machine IP address and port number. When `LOCAL_IP` is omitted, the ssh client binds on the localhost
* `DESTINATION:DESTINATION_PORT` - The IP or hostname, and the port of the destination machine
* `[USER@]SERVER_IP` - The remote SSH user and server IP address
